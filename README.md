**Demo project to show how to use Robot Pattern to write tests.**
The idea behind Robot Pattern is to write "Roboter" classes for all screens. 
Each Roboter should be able to to exactly that what a normal user can do on a screen.
For example click in input fields, write some text, click on buttons and so on.
Than this Roboter should be used to write tests. See MainActivityKtTest
